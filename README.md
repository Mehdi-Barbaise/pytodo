# pytodo
Graphical To-Do list made with Python

Tested on Gnome, KDE, and Windows environments.

Requirements: 
- Python3
- PyQt5
- Qt-material

Features:
Add a task, due date, description, mark it as "completed" (it then appears stripped).

I plan in the future to add a button to modify an existing task's information.

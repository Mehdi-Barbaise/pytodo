# pytodo
Graphical To-Do list made with Python

Tested on Gnome, KDE, and Windows 11 environments.

Requirements: 
- Python3
- PyQt5
- Qt-material

Features:
Add a task, sorted by due date, details while double-clicking on a task, mark it as "completed" (it then appears stripped and goes down the list), remove tasks, save tasks.

In the future, I plan to: 
- Correct some bugs (with the "--------------- Completed ---------------" line, that makes app crash when we select it and try to do "Remove" or "Mark as Completed")
- Enhance the "task list:" title
- Add a confirmation message when we click on "Save"
- add a button to modify an existing task's information.

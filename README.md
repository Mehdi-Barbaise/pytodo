# pytodo
Graphical To-Do list made with Python

Tested on Gnome, KDE, and Windows environments.

Requirements: 
- Python3
- PyQt5
- Qt-material

Features:
Add a task, sorted by due date, details while double-clicking on a task, mark it as "completed" (it then appears stripped and goes down the list), remove tasks, save tasks.

I plan in the future to add a button to modify an existing task's information.
